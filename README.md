# Final Project
Develop a ASP.NET MVC Core website using the IDE of your choice, using Git as a code repository. I recommend Azure Repos as they have unlimited free repositories. The website should document your one of your favorite hobbies. Examples of hobbies could include:
* A sport
* A sports team
* Games (card, video)
* Computers
* Reading
* Cooking
* Hiking
* Movies
* Etc.

<br />
<br />

## Requirements
Your website can be as large or small as you would like but should include the at least the following criteria:
1. Menu of some sort to navigate the website
2. 6+ pages (Home page + 5 other pages. About the hobby, about yourself, etc.)
3. 2+ controllers
4. A page about yourself
5. A database to hold information about your hobby. The database should simply contain a connection string to your local version of SQL Server. ((LocalDB)\.)
6. A page to display the database info
a. Possibly in an html table?
7. View folders per controllers
8. Shared folder with _Layout.cshtml
9. _Viewstart.cshtml
10. _ViewImports.cshtml
11. Migrations folder to create the DB artifacts
12. wwwroot folder with jquery, bootstrap, css, etc.
13. Connection string in appsettings.json and DBContext using I.o.C. (D.I.) into controllers after being registered in Program.cs
