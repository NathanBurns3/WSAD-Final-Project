            I've loved video games ever since I was young, I was a Nintendo fanboy at heart, 
            with a Nintendo DS, a Wii and Wii U, an eventually a Nintendo Switch. I would game on my Wii and 
            Switch for hours at a time. Back in the day I would get my friends over and we would game for hours.
            I even figured out how to homebrew my Wii U and install mods for games.c
